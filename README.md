# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

## __Discussion__ - 

**The Banking and Finance Industry** uses **_Data Science_ and _Machine Learning_** for various use cases such as Detection of Fraudulent Transactions , Customer Lifetime Value Predictions , Risk Modelling , Personalised Marketing and several others.<br> __Check them Out Here:__  <https://activewizards.com/blog/top-9-data-science-use-cases-in-banking/><br> In this Hands-On Lab Session we shall create Machine Learning Models that solve the essential and complex problem of Fraud Detection in Transactions to empower the Industry with **Real-Time Classification of Fraud**.Latest Machine Learning Techniques can help to solve this problem with a decent level of accuracy and in a very short time span.

This dataset............

## __Plan of Action__ - 
Let's structure and Plan the Methodology to go about solving this problem - 

- Brainstorming on why this problem MUST BE SOLVED and the impact of a great solution to the Industry

- Understading the Data , Exploring it's length , breadth and height ( How BIG , How DIVERSE , How GRANULAR )   Called : __EDA__

- __Visualisation of Data for Finding any specific Pattern or Flaw in the Data that can effect the Model__

- Finding the Complexities and Roadblocks for Modelling this particular Use Case

- Solving Use Case Specific Problems and consequently Handling Errors , Outliers and Missing Values in the Data

- Processing and Cleaning the Data to make it fit for Modelling and feeding to a Machine Learning Model

- Splitting the Dataset into Training and Testing Datasets

- Training the data on Multiple Classification Models

- Evaluating Models based on various Metrics and Understanding which metric is the most appropriate for Model Evaluation

- Lastly , disucssion on further ways to improve the model , feedback mechanism for the model and saving the model for future use
